For this purpose, we will use a spatially lumped model called CLASS (Chemistry Land-sufrace Atmosphere Soil Slab), developed by Waegeningen University the Netherlands. The main purpose of the model, which simulates the diurnal evolution of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is to allow for easy experimentation and provide insights on the soil-vegetation-atmosphere continuum. For more background information on the model, the reader is referred to the Atmospheric Boundary Layer handbook (Vilà-Guerau de Arellano et al. 2015).\nThroughout the text, variables are used consistent with how they were defined in the introductory slides of the practicals. Variables not mentioned during the introduction, are explicitly introduced in the text. Note that no text, including this one, is guaranteed to be free of mistakes or imperfections.

In the mixed ABL the temperature profile is nearly dry adiabatic, i.e. it closely follows the dry adiabatic lapse rate \\(\\Gamma_D \\approx -10\\) K/km (see Theory L2.5).

Remember however that soil moisture depletion is strongly regulated by both vegetation conditions and soil properties.\n\nThe soil regulates depletion of soil moisture via water infiltration and evaporation linked to soil structure and porosity.\nVegetation controls the depletion of soil moisture via its root-stem-leaf system functionality and its featured type of response to the environmental conditions. Hence, different vegetation and soil conditions will result in different \\(EF\\) values, and hence, the \\(EF\\)-\\(SM\\) relationship will change.\n\nIn CLASS, the effect of both soil and vegetation type can be explored. Under the Surface tab (subsection Surface properties), one can select:\n\nDominant vegetation cover: short grass (default), broadleaf trees and needleleaf trees\nSoil type: sandy loam (default), sand and clay\n\nFor the remainder of the practical, we’ll focus on the effect of vegetation on the surface energy partition, while keeping the default soil type across simulations.",

    "text": "2.5 Problem 3\nAs mentioned above, the goal is to now explore the effect of different vegetation conditions on the partitioning of surface energy into heat and moisture fluxes and on the \\(EF\\)-\\(SM\\) relationship. More specifically, the focus will be on the difference between short grass (reflective of the dominant vegetation cover in West Flanders) and broadleaf trees (reflective of the dominant vegetation cover in East Wallonia).\nTo set up the simulations, first clone experiment \\(C\\) from Section 2.2. This simulation is for short grass (\\(SG\\)). Now clone the latter experiment, and under the Surface tab, change the dominant vegetation cover from short grass to broadleaf trees, yielding a new experiment abbreviated by \\(BT\\). By this change, key parameters influencing the calculation of \\(r_s\\) are altered such as \\(LAI\\) and \\(r_{s,min}\\) parameter from the Jarvis-Stewart model (see introductory slides)2. For simplicity, we only want to focus on the effects of vegetation type on \\(r_s\\). Therefore, change following parameters for the \\(BT\\) experiment in the Adv. surf tab:\n\nThermal conductivity of the skin layer \\(\\Lambda\\): change the value from 20 W m\\(^{-2}\\) K\\(^{-1}\\) (the default for broadleaf trees) to 5.9 W m\\(^{-2}\\) K\\(^{-1}\\) (the default value for short grass). In this way, \\(SG\\) and \\(BT\\) have the same \\(\\Lambda\\) and consequently the calculation of \\(G\\) via3 \\(G = \\Lambda (T_s - T_{\\text{soil}1})\\) (where \\(T_{\\text{soil}1}\\) is the surface soil temperature) is not influenced by the vegetation type.\nFraction of surface covered by vegetation \\(C_{\\text{veg}}\\): change the value from 0.9 (the default for broadleaf trees) to 0.85 (the default value for short grass). In this way, \\(SG\\) and \\(BT\\) have the same \\(C_{\\text{veg}}\\) and consequently the calculation of the partitioning of \\(\\lambda E\\) between soil evaporation, transpiration and interception4 is only effected by the magnitude of these fluxes, not the fraction of vegetation cover.\n\n\n2.5.1 Task A\nBy comparing \\(SG\\) and \\(BT\\), how did \\(EF\\) change over forest compared to over grass?\n\n\n2.5.2 Task B\nAs mentioned above, the \\(LAI\\) differs between \\(BT\\) (\\(LAI = 5\\)) and \\(SG\\) (\\(LAI = 2\\)). To isolate the effect of \\(LAI\\), clone the \\(BT\\) experiment, call it \\(BT_{LAI2}\\) and change \\(LAI\\) to 2 in the Adv. surf tab.

To isolate the effect of \\(r_{s,min}\\), clone the \\(BT\\) experiment, call it \\(BT_{rsmin110}\\) and change \\(r_{s,min}\\) to 110 s m\\(^{-1}\\) in the Adv. surf tab.
